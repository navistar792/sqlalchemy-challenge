# Coding Highlights

## Climate_Starter.ipynb
### I included some queries and functions in the fist half of the file to getr familiar with the data, epecially:
* column names
* data types


## App.py
### I coded the date filters in the queries so that it would be suiatble for a non-static dataset - i.e. no hardcoding of dates. 

## Bonus/Extra Credit
* due to work schedule, I was not able to complete the extra credit work
